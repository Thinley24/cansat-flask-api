# cansat-flask-api
This is a Flask API build to expose YOLOv8 functionality of CanSat built for National Space Challenge (NSC) Project. 

** currently, Pagekite is used to expose the API from localhost. Other options could be ngrok, localtunnel and serveo. Pagekite was used in this project as it gives a fixed public URL unlike ngrok which changes everytime the Flask application is restarted. However, as Pagekite is a subscription based usage so it only provides free trail 31 days only.
